I’ve re-run the same code you shared on my local machine and ensured the timestamps were converted to PST. However, I’m still seeing a mismatch in the numbers compared to the Excel sheet you provided.

I’ve attached a sample table with the results I obtained for the specified date range. The row highlighted in red shows a significant delta that I’m unable to reconcile.

I suspect there may be a time zone alignment issue. Would it be possible to schedule a quick session so we can go through the code together and identify where the discrepancy might be coming from?

Looking forward to your help.
