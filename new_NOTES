You can use the following **Pandas code** to update the `summary` column **where `levenshtein_score` equals `fuzzy_partial_ratio`**:

```python
df_1.loc[df_1['levenshtein_score'] == df_1['fuzzy_partial_ratio'], 'summary'] = (
    "Character-level and partial-word differences detected, possibly typos or slight modifications."
)
