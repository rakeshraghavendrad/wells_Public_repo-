Feature Name	Description	Importance Level	Comments
Seal/Emblem Presence	Official government seals or logos are key markers of authenticity	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)	Must be present, sharp, aligned
Hologram Presence	IDs often use holograms as forgery deterrents	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)	Hard to fake, even visually
Watermark Clarity	Authentic IDs include embedded or transparent watermarks	⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)	Fuzzy or absent = red flag
Layout Consistency	Positioning of text boxes, logos, photo, etc.	⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)	Fakes often drift or misalign
Font Consistency	Uniform font styles and sizes used throughout	⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)	Fakes often mix fonts
Background Design Pattern	Security patterns, microgrids, or textures in the background	⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)	Easily missed in fakes
Color Scheme Accuracy	Government IDs often use strict color palettes	⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)	Inconsistencies suggest fakes
Shadow/Lighting Quality	Unnatural shadows indicate photo overlays or tampering	⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)	More visual than pixel-level
Material Texture	Lamination, matte/glossy textures visible in scan/photo	⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)	Limited with 2D photos, but useful if visible
Print Quality / Ink Bleed	Edge clarity, anti-aliasing, blur detection at micro level	⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)	Use edge detection or zoomed inspection
Barcode / QR Structure	Placement of digital code areas even if redacted	⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)	Structure matters, not the code content
Compression Artifacts	Fakes often contain JPEG artifacts due to editing or scanning	⭐⭐ (Low)	Check with pixel-wise entropy/patch smoothness
Tampering Marks	Signs of photo replacement, cropping, or resaving	⭐⭐ (Low)	Edge-level or corner-level inconsistencies
Symmetry in Element Placement	Are left/right margins, spacing uniform?	⭐⭐ (Low)	Helps spot poor forgery layout
Presence of Expected Blocks	Are photo box, signature zone, logo zone visible (even if masked)?	⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High)	Used in spatial layout classification
Microtext Regions	Tiny printed text that’s hard to fake	⭐⭐ (Low–Medium)	Use super-resolution if needed
Visual Noise	Blotches, reflections, print noise	⭐ (Very Low)	Optional for advanced model training
