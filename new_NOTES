LLM-Driven Image Classification Framework (for Real vs. Fake IDs)

🧩 Step 1: Mask the ID Image
Redact PII (e.g., name, number, photo).

Maintain layout structure: logos, alignment, font boxes, background.

✅ Purpose: LLM shouldn't see raw PII but should see the structure.

🔍 Step 2: Convert Image to Structured Visual Tokens (Vision Encoding)
You need to convert visual cues into descriptive tokens that an LLM can understand.

✅ Options:
Use a Visual Encoder like:

BLIP-2, LLaVA, GPT-4V, or OWL-ViT

Prompt the model to describe the ID’s layout, logos, alignment, text blocks, etc.

🎯 Example Prompt to a Vision-Language Model:
“This is a redacted government ID. Describe the document layout, positions of blocks, font alignment, visual features like logos or watermarks, signs of tampering, border irregularities.”

Output (hypothetical):
"Top-left contains a government seal. A photo box is visible but blanked. Text blocks are uneven. Logo is blurry. The background has inconsistent texture. Font sizes differ across lines."

🧠 Step 3: Use LLM for Reasoning + Classification
Now you pass that structured output into a pure LLM (like GPT, Claude, or LLaMA), along with domain-specific rules.

🧾 Prompt Template:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are an ID verification expert.

Here is the structured visual description of an ID:
- Seal present: Yes
- Layout: misaligned
- Font: inconsistent sizes
- Watermark: blurred
- Background texture: missing

Determine if the ID is likely real or fake. Justify your answer.
💡 LLM Output:
“The ID appears fake. The presence of inconsistent font sizes, missing background texture, and misaligned layout are strong indicators of forgery.”

📊 Step 4: Feedback Loop / Confidence Score
Ask LLM to return:

Classification: Real / Fake

Confidence Score: X%

Reasoning: [...]

This creates explainability for auditing and ML confidence.

🧠 Bonus: Train LLM on Few-Shot / Fine-Tuned Prompts
You can fine-tune or few-shot LLMs with examples:

Description	Label
“Perfect alignment, watermark visible, all fonts same”	Real
“Seal blurry, font mismatched, edge tampered”	Fake
Even using prompt engineering + few-shot, the LLM starts learning visual semantics.
