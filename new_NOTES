Inspired by Standard Lyapunov Exponent Formulas

The concept comes from Chaos Theory, where the Lyapunov Exponent is used to measure the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories.
The formula for computing Lyapunov Exponents generally follows:

In our function, this was approximated using np.diff() to compute changes in similarity scores.
Mathematical Approximation for Discrete Systems

Since similarity scores are discrete, we approximated the logarithmic divergence by:
Computing differences: np.diff(similarity_scores)
Taking the norm: np.linalg.norm(diffs)
Applying np.log(np.abs(norm_diffs + 1e-10)) to prevent log(0) issues.
