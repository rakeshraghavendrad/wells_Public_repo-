Step 2: Defining Classification Rules
If Levenshtein is the lowest and below 0.90 → Typos / Spelling errors.
If Jaro-Winkler is the lowest and below 0.90 → Reordering.
If Fuzzy Partial Ratio is the lowest and below 0.90 → Missing or extra words.
If all three scores are close (within 0.02-0.03 range of each other) → Minor formatting differences.
If two scores are equally low, prioritize classification:
Levenshtein + Partial Ratio low → Character-level & word-level typo.
Levenshtein + Jaro-Winkler low → Typos with reordering.
Partial Ratio + Jaro-Winkler low → Missing/Extra words + reordering.
