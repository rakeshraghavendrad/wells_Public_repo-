1. Basic Distribution & Overview
Classification Count:

Count of records per classification status (Verified, Not Verified, Fraud, Inconclusive, Recapture Needed).

Identify the most frequent classification category.

Time-Based Trends:

Analyze the number of IDs processed over time (daily, weekly, monthly).

Look for trends or spikes in specific classifications over time.

2. Fraud and Error Pattern Analysis
Age-Wise Fraud Analysis:

Check if certain age groups are more likely to have IDs flagged as "Fraud" or "Not Verified".

Inconclusive vs Recapture Needed:

Compare the frequency and characteristics of records marked as “Inconclusive” and “Recapture Needed”.

Identify any common features or patterns leading to these classifications.

Repeat Recapture Cases:

Identify users who are repeatedly flagged as “Recapture Needed”.

Investigate if there are common reasons (e.g., poor image quality, specific demographics).

3. Name and Demographic Patterns
Common Names in Fraud Cases:

List frequently occurring names in records marked as "Fraud".

Age Distribution by Classification:

Analyze how age varies across different ID classification statuses.

Plot age distributions for each class (e.g., boxplots or histograms).

4. Operational Metrics and Quality Control
Failure Rate:

Calculate the percentage of IDs classified as “Not Verified”, “Inconclusive”, or “Recapture Needed”.

Helps in assessing overall system accuracy and performance.

Conversion Funnel:

Analyze how many IDs progress from submission to final verification.

Identify dropout points in the pipeline (e.g., recapture requests, inconclusive outcomes).

Turnaround Time Analysis (if timestamps are available):

Measure the time taken from submission to final classification.

Identify any bottlenecks or delays.

5. Cross-Feature Exploration
Co-Occurrence of Labels:

Examine if certain classifications (e.g., Not Verified and Recapture Needed) co-occur frequently.

Useful for detecting systemic validation issues.

Correlation Matrix:

If numerical features are present (e.g., age, submission count), use a correlation heatmap to detect relationships between variables and classification outcomes.

6. Optional Analyses (if data is available)
Geographical or State-Wise Analysis:

Map classification results to regions or issuing authorities to identify areas with high fraud or error rates.

Issuing Authority Evaluation:

Evaluate whether certain DL issuing authorities are associated with higher rates of invalid or fraudulent IDs.

Visualization Recommendations
Pie chart or bar chart for classification distribution.

Time series plots for tracking classification trends.

Box plots for comparing age across classification types.

Heatmaps for regional patterns in ID outcomes.

Bar charts for most common names in fraud classifications.
