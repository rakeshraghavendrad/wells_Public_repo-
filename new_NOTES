Hi,

Please find the attached Excel file containing the address similarity scores. Below are the algorithms and weights I am currently using to calculate the address similarity:

Fuzzy Partial Ratio: Weight = 0.30
Levenshtein: Weight = 0.15
Jaro-Winkler: Weight = 0.55
In the Excel file, the output is available in the Test_similarity_score sheet. You can use the Score Range column to apply filters and review the Overall Similarity Score.

original_fulladdress_30_1: Customer input before data cleaning
original_fulladdress_94_1: Database input before data cleaning
The columns fulladdress_30 and fulladdress_94 are where I am performing the similarity scoring. This combination has shown a significant improvement in similarity scores in the 0.90-1.0 range, when compared to other combinations.

Please let me know if these similarity scores are feasible.

As discussed, I have updated the data dictionary by converting full forms to short forms (e.g., "#", "suite", "apt.") and removed duplicates before scoring. This is done to simplify the scoring process.

Let me know your thoughts, and if any further changes are required, Iâ€™m happy to look into i
