Subject: Follow-up on Data Count Validation and Clarifications

Hi Nandu,

Thank you very much for your time yesterday. With your help, we were able to successfully match the base population count for both PST and IST. Below is the filter that was used.

We do have a few follow-up questions and observations:

1. Mismatch in Counts for Specific Dates
We are currently trying to reconcile the counts for the following dates:
6/1/2025, 6/2/2025, 6/3/2025, and 6/5/2025.

When comparing our results with the shared Excel file (attached), we are seeing discrepancies in the counts.
I’ve used the same code that was shared earlier (also attached), but the mismatch still persists. The table below includes the numbers I’m currently seeing.

2. UTC to PST Conversion Logic in Code
Within the code, we noticed that the UTC timestamps are being converted to PST, yet the overall count remains unchanged.
We understand that PST is 7 hours behind UTC, and based on the logic, numbers from the previous UTC day are being added to the next PST day’s count.
However, shouldn’t those previous-day transactions be excluded from the next day's PST count? Could you help us understand why they’re being included?

Next Steps / Requests:

Could you please share the overall counts for the above dates using the filter provided?

To help us identify the cause of the mismatch, could you also share the Transaction IDs along with their datetime stamps for the following dates and descriptions?

Looking forward to your insights and support on this.

Best regards,
Rakesh
