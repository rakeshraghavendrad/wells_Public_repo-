Hi [Recipient's Name],

I conducted an analysis on the inclusion of short forms for similarity scoring in address data. The datasets I examined are:

Teradata (Ingested into OSDS)
Customer Input (Aug-Sep 2024) - NDDA Data
NDDA Database (Aug-Sep 2024) - NDDA Data

Methodology:
Extracted characters between positions 2 and 4 within the address strings.
Exploded the extracted substrings and applied the elbow method to determine the optimal frequency threshold.
Findings:
Short Form Analysis:
Teradata (Hogen Database): The elbow method identified 7 key short forms, which account for the majority of abbreviations in the database.
NDDA Customer Input Data: Identified 6 major short forms within customer-provided addresses.
NDDA Database Data: Similarly, 6 key short forms were observed.
Special Character Analysis:
Teradata: Identified the top 7 special characters present in the dataset.
NDDA Customer Data: Only 3 special characters were identified in customer-provided input.
NDDA Database Data: A total of 10 distinct special characters were found across the dataset.
Key Observations & Recommendation:
Special Character Handling: I recommend removing all special characters before performing similarity scoring. This is because customer inputs sometimes contain special characters while the database does not, and vice versa, leading to inconsistencies.
Impact on Similarity Scoring: Overall, there is no significant lift observed in the similarity score by adding more short forms. While some addresses moved from deciles 1-4, decile 10 remained constant, indicating limited impact on higher similarity matches.
