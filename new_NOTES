Iâ€™d like to confirm that the field in question pertains to whether the user has logged in via biometric authentication. We are not storing any actual biometric data or passwords.

Below are the distinct values in this column:

"1" indicates that the customer used biometric authentication.
"0" indicates that the customer did not use biometric authentication.
Additionally, the folder you mentioned was created during the initial stages of the project for research purposes. If needed, I can proceed with deleting it.

Upon reviewing the Excel SAR under the restricted data criteria, I only identified "biometric" as aligning with our use case. If you are looking for specific fields or need further clarification, please let me know.

I hope this information is helpful.
