I've compiled and categorized the reason codes in the attached Excel file. Please review and share your thoughts.

Additionally, I noticed that the DOB field displays as '*****,' which might indicate that the data is missing. Am I the only one seeing it this way? If this field isn't available, we may need to consult with the LOB to verify the data.

For our analysis, Iâ€™ve also combined the August and September data into a single CSV file. Please find the link attached.
