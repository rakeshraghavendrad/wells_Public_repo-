I wanted to provide you with an update on the Splash Campaign.

After conducting some research, I discovered that there are two teams running the Splash Campaign separately: the CE team and the SD team. It appears that neither team is aware of the other's campaign.

Currently, I have the table and column information from the CE team. However, for the SD team, I will need to start the process from scratch.

I'll keep you posted as I gather more details from the SD team.
