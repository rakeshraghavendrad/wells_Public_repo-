We have gathered a set of synthetic ID samples from publicly available datasets, which currently include driver's licenses from Arizona (AZ), South Dakota, and Nevada. We would like to evaluate the model's performance on this data.

We kindly request you to score these sample IDs using the vendor model currently deployed in the dev environment. Once the scoring is complete, please share the results with us.

Additionally, we will be sharing passport data as soon as it becomes available.
