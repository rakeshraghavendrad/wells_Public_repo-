During Q1, the team was split, and I was supporting four projects in parallel. 
Two were at the scoping stage, and two was a regular project. 
After the split, one of the projects was transferred to the parallel team, where I had to focus most of my efforts throughout the quarter. 
The parallel team acknowledged my contributions by sending me an e-card. 
However, I later realized that similar efforts were recognized with a Q1 Pillar Award, which my colleagues received.This made me feel that my contributions went unnoticed. 
Nevertheless, I still believe Wells Fargo is a great place to work, and I remain hopeful that my efforts will be recognized in the future.
