Implementing automated feature aggregation is crucial to eliminate potential human errors in the process, ensuring a more reliable and efficient model development.

Post-training, our system conducts manual checks on Accuracy and AUC, serving as a vital step to assess model performance, guard against overfitting or underfitting, and maintain the model's generalization capability.

Our system seamlessly auto-detects relevant dates, such as start and end dates, in comparison with the current month, streamlining the process and reducing manual efforts.

The automated detection of optimal train and test sizes serves as a proactive measure, preventing anomalies in data ingestion and contributing to a more robust and consistent model training process.

To enhance model integrity, our automation ensures a standardized 3-day window gap between train and test data, independent of the end date, promoting a more reliable evaluation framework.

Automation plays a key role in identifying and downsizing non-events in relation to events, optimizing data quality by addressing imbalances. This is crucial as a high prevalence of non-events can potentially overshadow key drivers in the machine learning algorithm.

Following model scoring, our system allows for a thorough check on the training and test scores, ensuring that any deviation remains within a 10% margin. This control mechanism adds an extra layer of scrutiny to guarantee consistency and reliability in model performance across different datasets.
