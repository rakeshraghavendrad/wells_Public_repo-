In my role, I successfully led the development of a comprehensive marketing response model, emphasizing proactive stakeholder identification and collaboration across multiple cross-functional teams. I facilitated the integration of the CAP database into Teradata by coordinating efforts among various teams, which streamlined marketing data extraction and improved efficiency. Through a thorough understanding of EDL architecture, I established secure data connections, enhancing data flow and integrity.

Prior to the model's deployment, I conducted rigorous data validation, identifying and resolving a critical discrepancy that ensured the accuracy of the marketing response score. My commitment to documentation not only aided the Support team but also provided a framework for future integrations, minimizing risks and ensuring consistency. Additionally, my support in manual labeling for the Transaction Factory enhanced data accuracy, while my published micro-paper on Generative AI garnered recognition at external conferences, showcasing my contributions to innovation in the AI domain. Overall, my work has significantly advanced project goals, improved operational efficiencies, and reinforced a culture of risk management within the organization.
