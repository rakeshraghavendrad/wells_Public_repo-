To generate the overall confidence score, we can utilize either classification or regression models. However, the requirement also calls for providing individual confidence scores for specific fields such as First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Address 1, and Address 2.

Here are potential approaches to achieve this:

Aggregate Similarity Scores:
Compute similarity scores for each field (e.g., Jaro-Winkler, Cosine Similarity) and aggregate them into a single average score to represent the overall confidence level.
Field-Specific Models:
Develop separate classification models for each field (First Name, Last Name, etc.) using their respective similarity scores. This allows for a more granular confidence score for each field individually.
Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs):
Use a single generative AI model to analyze and process the text fields (like names and addresses). The model can generate confidence scores based on how well the fields match.
Each approach offers a different way to break down and understand the confidence at both an individual field level and an overall match.
