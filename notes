I wanted to express my sincere thanks for your guidance and support. 
It is because of your belief in me that I have had the opportunity to be where I am today at Wells Fargo. I am truly grateful.

As I continue to grow in my career, 
I would greatly appreciate your continued mentorship and guidance. Your insights have been invaluable,
and I look forward to learning more under your direction.

Thank you import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Pandas to Spark").getOrCreate()

# Read the file into pandas DataFrame
pandas_df = pd.read_csv('input_file.csv')

# Get the original column names from the pandas DataFrame
original_columns = pandas_df.columns.tolist()

# Convert pandas DataFrame to Spark DataFrame
spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(pandas_df)

# Manually set the column names in Spark DataFrame to match the original pandas DataFrame
spark_df = spark_df.toDF(*original_columns)

# Check if the column names are correct before writing
print("Column names before writing:", spark_df.columns)

# Write the Spark DataFrame to CSV and retain original column names
spark_df.write.csv('output_file.csv', header=True, mode='overwrite')

# Verify the written file to check if the column names are retained
written_df = spark.read.csv('output_file.csv', header=True)
print("Column names after writing:", written_df.columns)
