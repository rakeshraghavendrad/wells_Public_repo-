I have explored various sources and narrowed down to the Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) approach to evaluate the propensity scores shared by the vendor. This method reweights each record based on its likelihood of receiving a specific outcome, creating a balanced dataset that mimics a randomized setting. It helps assess the modelâ€™s fairness and performance across diverse input conditions by removing bias from unevenly distributed features. This ensures a more reliable validation of the vendor model.
