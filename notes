Dear [Recipient],

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently liaising with the data injection team, and there is a specific need for an Event Data Lake (EDL) path tailored to the propensity mode.

As of now, our existing path is aligned with the bal forecast, but we require confirmation if there is a designated path for the propensity model. If such a path exists, kindly provide the details at your earliest convenience.

In case there isn't a predefined path, we are prepared to initiate a ticket for the creation of a new path. You can find the ticket creation link below for your reference.

Your prompt attention to this matter is highly appreciated.

Best regards,

# Convert segments to numerical labels
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
df['Segment_Labels'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['Segment'])

# Split data into features and target variable
X = df[['Segment_Labels']]  # Features
y = df['Target']  # Target variable

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Choose a classification model (Random Forest in this example)
model = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
predicted_probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Normalize the scores using Min-Max Normalization
min_max_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
normalized_scores = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(predicted_probabilities.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()

# Aggregate propensity scores at the customer level
customer_propensity_score = normalized_scores.mean()

print(f"Customer Propensity Score (Normalized): {customer_propensity_score}")


Normalization Step:
Min-Max Normalization:
For each customer's predicted probability score, apply min-max normalization using the formula:

Normalized Score
=
Score
−
Min(Scores)
Max(Scores)
−
Min(Scores)
Normalized Score= 
Max(Scores)−Min(Scores)
Score−Min(Scores)

import pandas as pd

# Example data
data = {
    'CustomerID': [1, 2, 3],
    'Segment': ['High feature - high session', 'Low feature - high session', 'No feature - low session'],
    'Target': [1, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive outcome, 0 for negative outcome
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Assign weights to each segment
segment_weights = {
    'High feature - high session': 0.9,
    'Low feature - high session': 0.8,
    'No feature - high session': 0.7,
    'High feature - low session': 0.6,
    'Low feature - low session': 0.5,
    'No feature - low session': 0.4,
    'No feature - no session': 0.3
}

# Create a weighted target variable
df['Weighted_Target'] = df['Segment'].map(segment_weights) * df['Target']

print(df[['CustomerID', 'Segment', 'Weighted_Target']])

Pass Weighted Target Variable to the Model:

# Continue from the previous code

# Convert segments to numerical labels
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
df['Segment_Labels'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['Segment'])

# Split data into features and target variable
X = df[['Segment_Labels']]  # Features
y_weighted = df['Weighted_Target']  # Weighted target variable

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y_weighted, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Choose a classification model (Random Forest in this example)
model = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Continue from the previous code

# Make predictions on the testing set
predicted_probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Continue from the previous code

# Normalize the scores using Min-Max Normalization
min_max_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
normalized_scores = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(predicted_probabilities.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()

# Aggregate propensity scores at the customer level
aggregated_propensity_score = normalized_scores.mean()

print(f"Aggregated Propensity Score: {aggregated_propensity_score}")

 

This transforms the scores to a scale between 0 and 1.

Aggregation Step:
Aggregate Propensity Scores:
After normalizing the scores, you can aggregate them at the customer level. This can be done by averaging the normalized scores.
