Contextual understanding and the enhancement of contextual awareness are key research areas in artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and mobile computing. Context-aware systems dynamically adapt to changing environments and user needs by analyzing various contextual factors such as location, time, and user activity. Ongoing research is focused on improving methods for context acquisition, modeling, and reasoning. For instance, context-aware computing is becoming essential in ubiquitous computing environments, where systems need to be highly adaptable. Additionally, AI systems, including large language models, are being designed to better process and prioritize contextual information through methods like context-aware decoding, which enhances their response accuracy. This is particularly important in natural language processing and mobile computing, where systems must sense and react intelligently to environmental stimuliâ€‹
