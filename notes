Led the design and implementation of machine learning-based diagnostic models, enhancing digital user experience for over 1.3 million monthly users by identifying pain points and delivering predictive solutions with measurable business impact.

Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including Product, Engineering, and Risk, to identify high-impact analytical use cases. Developed modular, reusable code assets to streamline model development and accelerate deployment timelines.

Developed robust data pipelines and dashboards using Power BI to monitor operational KPIs and behavioral drivers, enabling real-time decision-making and performance tracking.

Built and deployed propensity models to segment and re-engage low-activity users, achieving a measurable reduction in customer churn and improving digital engagement metrics.

Architected and led end-to-end development of scalable entity-matching systems for bank transfers, integrating real-time inference using Kafka and Spark for high-throughput environments.

Established standardized ML pipelines, automating workflows for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and monitoringâ€”enabling reproducibility and compliance with internal audit requirements.

Utilized scalable ML frameworks including H2O Sparkling Water with PySpark, leveraging algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and GLM to evaluate model performance. The best-performing models were promoted for production scoring.

Worked closely with MLOps and Model Risk Management (MRM) teams to ensure rigorous model validation, audit documentation, and seamless deployment to production environments in line with regulatory guidelines.
