Iâ€™m Rakesh from the Digital Customer Experience team. I have designed the banner response based on the table data, and I noticed that the IA_ECN column is populated for August 2024, but it remains empty for September 2024.

Could you kindly update the table to include the IA_ECN data for September 2024 as well?
