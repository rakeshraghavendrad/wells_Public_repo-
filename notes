Subject: Issue with Booking Blood Tests via MediBuddy App

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to bring to your attention a recurring issue I have been facing with the MediBuddy app. Despite uploading a valid prescription from MediBuddy, I have been unable to book any blood tests successfully.

On a recent occasion, I uploaded a prescription for a blood test that included all necessary details. However, the request was rejected. Upon contacting MediBuddy support, I was asked to book a new appointment, which resulted in a two-day waiting period. This delay caused me to miss my doctor's appointment, and I had to bear the cost of the test out of my own pocket.

More recently, I consulted a doctor and obtained another prescription for a blood test. When I uploaded this new prescription, it was rejected again, this time because the prescription lacked a "Description" column (attached screenshot). Typically, prescriptions in India do not include a description column; they only list the prescribed medications, injections, or tests.

This situation raises a concern: should I be instructing the doctor to add a description, or should MediBuddy inform doctors about this requirement?

It feels disheartening to have these benefits but be unable to utilize them effectively when needed.

I kindly request your assistance in resolving this issue. I am available to discuss this further at your convenience.

Thank you for your attention and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
