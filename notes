# Load your data
data = {
    'CustomerID': [1, 2, 3],
    'Segment': ['High feature - high session', 'Low feature - high session', 'No feature - low session'],
    'Target': [1, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive outcome, 0 for negative outcome
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert segments to numerical labels
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
df['Segment_Labels'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['Segment'])

# Split data into features and target variable
X = df[['Segment_Labels']]  # Features
y = df['Target']  # Target variable

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Choose a classification model (Random Forest in this example)
model = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
predicted_probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Normalize the scores using Min-Max Normalization
min_max_scaler = MinMaxScaler()
normalized_scores = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(predicted_probabilities.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()

# Aggregate propensity scores at the customer level
customer_propensity_score = normalized_scores.mean()

print(f"Customer Propensity Score (Normalized): {customer_propensity_score}")


Normalization Step:
Min-Max Normalization:
For each customer's predicted probability score, apply min-max normalization using the formula:

Normalized Score
=
Score
−
Min(Scores)
Max(Scores)
−
Min(Scores)
Normalized Score= 
Max(Scores)−Min(Scores)
Score−Min(Scores)
​
 

This transforms the scores to a scale between 0 and 1.

Aggregation Step:
Aggregate Propensity Scores:
After normalizing the scores, you can aggregate them at the customer level. This can be done by averaging the normalized scores.
