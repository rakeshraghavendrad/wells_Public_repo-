Sure, here's a refined version of your text:

This table is updated daily. For instance, if we want to retrieve data for June 24, 2024, we should query the table around July 3, 2024, to account for the update lag. Therefore, we need to wait until July 3 to access the data.

The second table's data becomes accessible every second week of the following month. For example, to access June 24, 2024, data, we should query the table in the second week of July 2024, around July 15.

I have also learned that the tables, which are updated monthly, have different names but contain the same data. The table names include a date stamp indicating their creation date. For example, Table 1 might contain data for six months, while the new Table 2 will include data for seven months.

To address this issue, we contacted the Amos team. Their suggestion is to star the date, along with the month and year, so the latest file will be automatically selected.
