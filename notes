Instead of assigning fixed weightages of 55% to Jaro-Winkler, 15% to Levenshtein, and 30% to Partial Ratio, we can take a dynamic approach. We evaluate the scores from all three similarity metrics—Jaro-Winkler, Levenshtein, and Partial Ratio—and assign weightages based on their relative strengths. The highest-scoring metric receives the highest weight of 50%, the second-highest gets 30%, and the lowest-scoring metric is weighted at 20%. This ensures that the most relevant similarity measure contributes more to the final similarity score.
