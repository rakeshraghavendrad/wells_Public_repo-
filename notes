Hi Team,

I wanted to provide an update regarding the t_mat table (banner table). It appears that the table contains cust_num entries only up to August 24, with no entries from after that date.

To investigate further, I have raised a support ticket. According to the response, the cust_num field in the t_mat table was decommissioned after being in use for over 10 years. However, the support team has provided an alternative method to populate the cust_num. I’m still in the process of testing this new approach to ensure its validity.

At this point, I see two potential solutions:

Delay the rollout: We could allow for a month’s delay, during which we would test the new approach, implement the necessary code changes in production, re-ingest the t_mat data, and validate both the data and the response.

Proceed without the banner response for now: Alternatively, we could move forward without including the banner response in the current model release, and address this in phase 2 with the necessary corrections.

Please advise on how you'd like to proceed.
