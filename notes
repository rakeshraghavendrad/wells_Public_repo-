Example:
Comparing:
"MARTHA"
"MARHTA"
Step-by-Step Calculation:
Matching characters: "MARTHA" and "MARHTA"

They have the same characters in different positions.
Matching = 6 characters (M A R T H A).
Transpositions:

"MARTHA" → "MARHTA"
The only difference is the swapped T and H, so transpositions = 1.
