I am writing to inform you that I have recently undergone a minor medical procedure. As a result, I have been advised by my doctor to rest and avoid commuting for a few days to ensure a smooth recovery.

To maintain productivity and continue fulfilling my responsibilities, I would like to request permission to work from home from [start date] to [end date]. During this period, I will be fully accessible via email, phone, and any other necessary communication platforms, and I will ensure that all my tasks and projects are managed effectively.
