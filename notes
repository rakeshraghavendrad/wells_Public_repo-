Minimal Category
In the Minimal category, customers who are new to digital banking channels often find themselves overwhelmed by the multitude of options and services available. This group typically includes individuals who are either inexperienced with digital platforms or new to banking altogether. For these users, the primary need is simplicity and clarity. They require a user interface (UI) that provides only the most essential services, such as checking account balances, viewing recent transactions, and transferring funds between accounts. By limiting the complexity of available options, the platform can help minimize confusion and reduce the likelihood of errors. This approach not only enhances the user experience but also builds the confidence of customers as they gradually familiarize themselves with the digital banking environment.

Intermediate Category
As customers spend more time interacting with digital banking platforms, they become increasingly comfortable and knowledgeable about the services offered. The Intermediate category represents users who have progressed beyond the basic level and are now seeking additional functionality to manage their finances more effectively. These users are likely to explore features such as budgeting tools, bill payments, investment options, and financial planning services. The UI for this group should be designed to strike a balance between simplicity and sophistication, offering a wider range of services without overwhelming the user. By providing contextual assistance, personalized recommendations, and easy-to-navigate menus, the platform can support customers as they expand their financial knowledge and take greater control over their financial well-being.

Expert Category
The Expert category encompasses customers who are highly proficient in using digital banking platforms and possess a deep understanding of financial services. These users demand full access to the platform's features and expect a high degree of customization and control over their banking experience. They are likely to engage in complex transactions, manage multiple accounts, and utilize advanced tools for wealth management, trading, and financial analysis. For this group, the UI should be designed to offer maximum flexibility, allowing users to tailor the platform to their specific needs and preferences. Advanced features such as API access, detailed analytics, and integration with third-party financial tools may also be desirable. By catering to the sophisticated needs of expert users, the platform can foster long-term loyalty and encourage these customers to fully leverage the bank's digital offerings.
