Initially, I believed the total count of 700K customers was due to applied filters in the query. Upon closer inspection, I realized an additional filter was in place, requiring the "bev_evnt_id" to be unique, resulting in the 700K count. However, when I removed all filters for the month of Aug-23 and counted customers based on both the same and different IP addresses, the total reached 2.4M. Comparing this with the 2.2M distinct customers facing the issue, it made sense, as the customer "ecn" could be a repetition among customers sharing the same or different IP addresses.
