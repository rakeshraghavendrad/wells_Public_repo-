Extending ARIMA Models for Multi-Step Forecasting (1.5 marks):
1. Recursive Forecasting:

Recursive forecasting involves using the model to predict one step ahead, incorporating this prediction into the dataset, and then using the updated dataset to predict the next step, and so on. In the context of ARIMA models, this means refitting the model after each step and using the updated model for subsequent predictions. Recursive forecasting ensures that the forecasted values influence the model's subsequent predictions. However, this method can accumulate errors over time, especially if the initial predictions are not accurate, leading to a less accurate long-term forecast.

2. Direct Forecasting:

Direct forecasting, also known as multi-horizon forecasting, involves building a single model that directly predicts multiple future time steps at once. In the context of ARIMA, this means extending the differencing and autoregressive components to capture the relationships for the multiple forecast steps. Direct forecasting can be more accurate over the long term, especially if the underlying patterns in the time series data are captured effectively. However, it can be challenging to find an appropriate model specification, especially for longer forecast horizons, and the model might not adapt well to short-term changes in the data.

Challenges and Considerations in Multi-Step Forecasting with ARIMA (1.5 marks):
1. Model Complexity:

As the forecasting horizon increases, the model needs to capture more complex patterns in the data. This complexity can strain the capabilities of ARIMA models, especially if the underlying patterns are nonlinear or if there are significant fluctuations in the time series.

2. Error Accumulation:

In recursive forecasting, errors in the early predictions can accumulate, leading to less accurate forecasts in the later steps. This error propagation can significantly impact the reliability of long-term predictions.

3. Seasonality and Trend Changes:

If the time series exhibits changing seasonality or trends, capturing these variations accurately for multiple steps ahead can be challenging. ARIMA models might struggle to adapt quickly to abrupt changes in the data, leading to inaccuracies in multi-step forecasts.

4. Model Selection:

Selecting an appropriate ARIMA order (p, d, q) becomes crucial. Using techniques like grid search or automated model selection algorithms can help, but the search space increases exponentially with the forecast horizon, making the process computationally intensive.

5. Data Stationarity:

ARIMA models assume stationarity in the time series data. Ensuring stationarity for multiple steps ahead might require more advanced techniques like seasonal differencing or transforming the data, which can complicate the modeling process.
