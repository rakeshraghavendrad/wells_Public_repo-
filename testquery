Certainly! Here are the reformulated statements for better clarity:

1. **Join Data:** I encountered a module error while attempting to join the data. Upon inspecting the module, I realized there's no module named "join."

2. **Data Sample:** I'm facing the same "no module found" error as mentioned above.

3. **Splitting the Data into Train and Test Sets:** To enhance clarity, we've named the variables as `train_date_range`, `test_date_range`, and `validation_date_range` for better understanding.

4. **Sum of Last N Days:** The code displays forward N dates but doesn't represent the previous N dates. If it does, please specify the column to check.

5. **Filling Missing Data with a Certain Value:** The provided code effectively fills in missing values in the "group" column. However, it should also fill the same value in the "ID" column, considering it's a unique value for each row. I attempted converting the ID column to a string, but the code didn't work as expected.

6. **Categorical Feature Missing Data:** Using the mode-filling method for the "group" column works well. However, when I try the same method for filling the "ID" column (any categorical variable), the data is not being populated.

Feel free to let me know if you need further assistance with any of these points!
