Build:

I understood the various data center placed in various locations.
I had to self-scale up on this technology.
I had to completely translate the Teradata query to PySpark query in order to create the pipeline on OSDS.
The dashboard was initiated with the bi-team.
From the pipelines developed 9 versatile components are created as a reusable component for the cross-function team.
This task just not enhanced the cross-functional teams' capabilities also enhanced the scalability and reusability of modules with the company’s system.
Enable:

The communication to servers was mainly done on Teradata and PySpark on OSDS.
The model helped to reduce the execution time.
During this process, I had to completely translate the Teradata query to PySpark query.
The complete KT was provided to data engineering teams and empowered them on the reusable versatile modules.
This task has brought into the limelight of the company’s system.
Whenever the team needs the analysis my time for this was given promptly.
Deliver:

The model gives the output.
The required reports were gathered.
This effort has saved a lot of manpower time and improved and highly efficient way of reporting.
I have been awarded a Team Spotlight Award.
I was also involved in Swart analysis which needed a complex SQL query to be developed to get the required results.
I delivered the projects within the deadline.
