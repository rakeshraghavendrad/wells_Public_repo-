Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone,

Today, I'm excited to share insights about our Digital Friction Dashboard, a powerful tool designed to provide a comprehensive overview of user issues and enhance our understanding of customer experiences. Let's dive into the key features of our dashboard, which is divided into three blades.

Blade 1: Digital Friction Summary

In this blade, we empower you with the flexibility to switch between two critical issues: "Multiple Login" and "FPR" (whatever FPR stands for). Not only that, but you can also customize the date range, allowing for dynamic analysis.

The bar graph at the center provides a month-on-month breakdown of the total population facing issues. To the left, we find the average population and the percentage of users encountering problems. On the left line graph, we explore issues by device type (phone, desktop, tablet), while the right line graph delves into the operating system aspect, distinguishing between iOS and Android.

Blade 2: Top Drivers

Moving on to the second blade, "Top Drivers." This blade grants you the freedom to switch between "Multiple Login" and "FPR," adjust the date range, and even filter by OS types and specific drivers.

The table below reveals critical driver data, showcasing driver names, month/year, the number of impacted customers, the percentage of impacted customers, likelihood of customers facing issues, and a new driver indicator. Arrows indicate whether a driver is new compared to the previous month, and an indicator highlights drivers that are entirely new.

Accompanying this, a line graph illustrates the trends on a month-on-month basis for the number of customers impacted, the percentage of customers impacted, and the likelihood of customers facing issues.

Blade 3: Breakdown for iOS and Android

In our third blade, we break down customer issues based on authentication types for iOS and Android. On the left, we explore iOS devices, including Face ID, Touch ID, and User ID, while the right side details Android devices, encompassing Biometric and User ID. Once again, you have the flexibility to customize the date range for in-depth analysis.

These features collectively empower us to visualize customer issue trends concerning authentication types on a month-on-month basis.

In conclusion, our Digital Friction Dashboard provides a holistic view of user challenges, offering you the tools needed to make informed decisions and enhance customer satisfaction. Thank you.
